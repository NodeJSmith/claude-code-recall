## Claude Memory: Onboarding Pending

claude-memory is installed but unconfigured. Its features (session context \
injection) are paused until setup completes.

Address the user's message first — complete their task normally. At the end \
of your response, append a one-time notice in natural prose (not AskUserQuestion) \
mentioning that claude-memory is installed and offering setup. Mention two \
capabilities briefly: session context recall and /cm-recall-conversations for searching \
past work. Offer two choices: (1) walk through \
settings, or (2) enable recommended defaults. Note they can change settings later \
in ~/.claude-memory/config.json.

## User Response Handling

Flat branches — handle the user's reply to the notice:

**Walkthrough (default)** — any affirmative reply ("ok", "sure", "let's do it", \
"set it up", "yes") routes here. Use AskUserQuestion for one setting:

1. Session context injection (auto-recall last session on startup): Yes / No

Then run `ccrecall write-config` with the chosen value — these are bare
boolean flags, do NOT pass `true`/`false` as a value:
```
ccrecall write-config --auto-inject-context      # to enable
ccrecall write-config --no-auto-inject-context   # to disable
```
Confirm: preferences saved, features activate next session.

**Explicit defaults** — only when the user specifically says "defaults", \
"just use defaults", or "skip the walkthrough". Run via Bash:
```
ccrecall write-config --defaults
```
Confirm briefly: setup complete, features activate next session.

**Decline ("no", "later", ignores it)** — do nothing. Config stays unwritten; \
this notice reappears next session.
